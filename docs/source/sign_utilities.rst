.. Warning:: Critical items to be addressed before the PEER code is migrated to open source. Should each include a link to a corresponding Pivotal Tracker story or shall we try to use `issue`_ in GitHub instead?

.. Tip:: Non-essential items that we would like to address before the PEER code is migrated to open source.  May includes a link to a Pivotal Tracker story in some cases.

.. Note::  Future extensions and/or modifications for consideration by anyone interested in enhancing PEER's functionality, and looking for project opportunities.  To learn more about creating new modules for PEER, read Developer suggestions.
