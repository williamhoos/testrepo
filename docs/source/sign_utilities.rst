Shared utilities

As indicated by the :ref:`Sign-up or sign-in` workflow description, the sign-up and sign-in processes share 3 utility functions to toggle on/off a remember user function and recover lost credentials.  

Workflows for these functions are described below:

.. _Remember me function:

.. Attention:: Verify the "Remember Me" option works (and confirm it **only** works) when a returning user seeks access from a previously used hardware device.

.. Note:: Try to add an option for Users to select the "Remember Me" option directly from the :ref:`Activate Account` page.

.. Hint:: Consider adding active monitoring intellegence to identify suspicious user activity.


.. _Recover lost credentials:

.. Attention:: Verify that the reset password token has a responsible expiry term.

.. Attention:: Make any changes to these documents that are required in conjunction with the migration to OSS.

.. Note:: Time and budget permitting, find ways to simplify the language to better reflect the truly simplified nature of the relationship from the perspective of end-users, which is presently mired in considerable legalese.
