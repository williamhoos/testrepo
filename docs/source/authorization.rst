==============================
Authorization & Proxy Settings 
==============================

As indicated in the summary of the :ref:`Authorization` workflow, depending on whether the organization through whom a participant registered is willing to serve as a proxy, an individual user has several ways to designate the person(s) and/or group(s) to whom he or she authorizes to act on their behalf.  This could take place immediately following creation of a new account (or for an existing user, immediately after signing into anothr organization's PEER portal for the first time).  In those cases, where the portal sponsor has indicated a willingness or desire to serve as a proxy for participants, the participant is provided an opportunity to accept the default setttings, as follows:
