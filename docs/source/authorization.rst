Authorization & Proxy Settings 
==============================

As indicated in the summary of the :ref:`Authorization` workflow, depending on whether the organization through whom a participant registered is willing to serve as a proxy, an individual user has several ways to designate the person(s) and/or group(s) to whom he or she authorizes to act on their behalf.  

As indicated, the PEER sponsor's General Settings (summarized in the shaded box) include a willingness to serve as a proxy *and* include defualt authorization settings in this regard, these are reflected in the "We're here for you" screen that is displayed to the user.  Where the portal sponsor has indicated a willingness or desire to serve as a proxy for participants, the participant is provided an opportunity to accept these default setttings, or to customize them before getting started:

Accept default settings, if desired

Accepting the default selections confirms these proxy settings and skips directly to the :ref:`Contact Info` screen.  Alternatively, where an account holder wishes to modify or decline to accept the organization's default settings, then by clicking on the Customize button the Account Holder can customize the extent of his or her delegation of authority to the portal sponsor organization. 

.. Note::  While it is possible to decline the proxy offer, currently this is achieved by "customizing" the default settings to effectively render such designation as being irrelevant.  In the future, we may want to consider adding a more direct "decline proxy" selection.

Such customization is illustrated by the following workflow drawing:
