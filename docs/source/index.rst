PEER for Open Source Documentation
==================================

====================
Contributing to PEER
====================

Improving PEER's code, documentation and tests are ongoing tasks.  While these are never going to be "finished", thanks to almost a decade of work by PEER's founders and the support of several early adopter organizations and sponsors, a relatively well developed body of work already exists.  With the support of the founding members of the PEER Open Source community, a 4-month intensive effort was dedicated to creating a baseline representation of the PEER code as of the date the PEER code [will be] migrated from closed to open source software.  This effort permitted the artifacts of approximately five years of continuous development sprints to be scrubbed, functional test suites to be developed, and documentation to be created. 

As an integral part of this effort, a number of potential development activities were identified as possible areas for future enhancement, and these are identified throughout the documentation.
