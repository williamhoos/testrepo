.. _Introduction to PEER OSS:

PEER for Open Source Documentation
==================================

====================
Contributing to PEER
====================

Improving PEER's code, documentation and tests are ongoing tasks.  While these are never going to be "finished", thanks to almost a decade of work by PEER's founders and the support of several early adopter organizations and sponsors, a relatively well developed body of work already exists.  With the support of the founding members of the PEER Open Source community, a 4-month intensive effort was dedicated to creating a baseline representation of the PEER code as of the date the PEER code [will be] migrated from closed to open source software.  This effort permitted the artifacts of approximately five years of continuous development sprints to be scrubbed, functional test suites to be developed, and documentation to be created. 

As an integral part of this effort, a number of potential development activities were identified as possible areas for future enhancement, and these are identified throughout the documentation as follows:
 
.. Attention:: Critical item that will be addressed before the PEER code is migrated to open source, and that references a Pivotal Tracker story or open item in GitHub Issues.

.. Note::  Non-essential enhancement that, time/budget allowing, may be incorporated before the PEER code is migrated to open source, or that will be changed to a "Hint" at that time.  

.. Hint:: Suggested future extensions and/or modifications for consideration by anyone interested in enhancing PEER's functionality, and looking for future project opportunities.
