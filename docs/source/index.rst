Documenting the Migration of PEER to Open Source Software
=========================================================

This document provides documentation regarding the subsystems that collectively make up the Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly (PEER), including the elements that are provided through API calls to Private Access Connect and PrivacyLayer, two independent services that are licensed from Private Access.  The documentation is divided into the three major sections of the PEER system, and in turn to the subsystems and individual components for the following community facing components:

* :ref:`Participant`
* :ref:`Administrator`
* :ref:`Researcher`

The Participant portion of PEER is comprised of 9 major sub-components, illustrated above and described in the following sub-sections. It is **recommended** that the documents be read in the order listed, so if you elect to skip around within the documentation, be aware that it is written assuming that the preceding documentation has been read so you may find it necessary to backtrack to fill in missing concepts and terminology.

Participant Engagement 
======================

PEER is designed to support sponsors in employing various forms of engagement.

Proposing changes to PEER
-------------------------

Improving PEER's code, documentation and tests are ongoing tasks.  While these are never going to be "finished", thanks to the efforts of PEER's founders and the support of several early adopter organizations and sponsors, 4-month intensive effort was dedicated to creating a baseline representation immediately prior to PEER being migrated from closed to open source software.  This effort permitted the artifacts of approximately five years of continuous development sprints to be scrubbed, functional test suites to be developed and documentation to be created. 

As an integral part of this effort, a number of potential development activities were identified as possible areas for future enhancement, and these are identified throughout the documentation.
