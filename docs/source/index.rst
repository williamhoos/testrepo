PEER for Open Source Documentation
==================================

====================
Contributing to PEER
====================

Improving PEER's code, documentation and tests are ongoing tasks.  While these are never going to be "finished", thanks to almost a decade of work by PEER's founders and the support of several early adopter organizations and sponsors, a relatively well developed body of work already exists.  With the support of the founding members of the PEER Open Source community, a 4-month intensive effort was dedicated to creating a baseline representation of the PEER code as of the date the PEER code [will be] migrated from closed to open source software.  This effort permitted the artifacts of approximately five years of continuous development sprints to be scrubbed, functional test suites to be developed, and documentation to be created. 

As an integral part of this effort, a number of potential development activities were identified as possible areas for future enhancement, and these are identified throughout the documentation as follows:
 
.. Warning:: Critical items needing to be addressed before the PEER code is migrated to open source. Each will include a link to a Pivotal Tracker story or an open issue in GitHub Issues.

.. Tip:: Other items that we would like to address before the PEER code is migrated to open source, but that are not considered to be essential. 

.. Note:: Future extensions and/or modifications for consideration by anyone interested in enhancing PEER's functionality, and looking for project opportunities, possibly with a link to a welcome message similar to the `Apache Foundation <http://community.apache.org/contributors/index.html>`.
