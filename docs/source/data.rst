As indicated in the :ref:`Overview` discussion respecting :ref:`Data`, this section describes how PEER presently handles data from the point that it is initially entered into the system by a user, proxy or administrator, to the point that that data is either viewable onscreen or appears in an exported file or document, or is taken into account in any calculation of reported results. 

Where not self-descriptive, this section includes an explanation of each function and/or subroutine thatâ€™s involved in this process, including its range of input and output values, any associated program variables and constants, and an explanation for how these are used by the application in handling or manipulating data; and
