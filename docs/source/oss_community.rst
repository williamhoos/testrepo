Contibuting to the PEER OSS community
=====================================

We begin by acknowledging that as PEER's reach has grown over the past several years, we've received a significant level of internet in using PEER if the underlying software were available via open sources.  While this interest has been expressed most often by academic, non-profit, and governmental user groups and prospective sponsros, we've also received similar inquiries from several very large corporations and agencies.  

We've heard expressed a number of reasons for this interest, ranging from groups who perceive open source software as being more aligned with the fundamental beliefs about distributed control that underpin PEER itself, to others who feel that by the source code being open it will enable much more rapid innovation, and yet others who feel that by the code being open, it provides a more accountable and stable basis for remaining accessible to collaborators no matter what may happen to one group or another in the future. Whatever the reason - and we are certain that they are many and varied - we hope this portends a very active and committed community of interest including sponsors, users and software developers.

This initiative represents an outgrowth of all of these expressions of interest for the PEER software to be migrated from closed to open source software.

Although Genetic Alliance owns the PEER software and all related trade and service marks, names and URLs, and hosts a public-facing instance of PEER that it offers under a software-as-a-service (SaaS) style offering for groups who simply wish to create and maintain a registry based on the most up-to-date version of the production system built from the master branch of the source code, the PEER OSS initiative functions as a separate, self-supported initiative supported by those organizations and donors who see the inherent value in the source code for PEER being available under an open-source software license.  Funds that are contributed to Genetic Alliance as one time gifts, grants and/or annual membership fees that are earmarked as being for the express purpose of supporting the PEER OSS initiative are not comingled with any other revenues.

In order to ensure that the PEER code serves the community, the projects that are undertaken using funds contributed to the PEER OSS initiative are selected based on a collaborative, consensus-based process that is open to all participants.  This process ultimately leads to the determination of strategy and priorities based on a vote of Directors.  

During 2016, the three activities to which all membership fees that are collected are being expended are:

   1.  Auditing, scrubbing and documenting the PEER source code as a prepatory activity to migrating it to the open source repository 
   
   2.  Establishing the governance and licensing structure necessary to formalize the open source grant by Genetic Alliance
   
   3.  Salaries and costs for the staff that are required to handle the administrtive and support duties for the code reposity
   
Genetic Alliance plans to convene all Directors and Members in early 2017 to review the success of the foregoing activities and to establish the PEER OSS initiative priorities for 2017.

From the outset, our goal in making PEER open source is a desire we believe all PEER directors, members, service providers and participants share of creating high quality software that is stable, sustainable, robust in features, and that embodies the foundational principle of being participant-centered, meaning that each particpant is able to determine how much or little of his or her information is shared with others, when and for what purpose.  

Thanks to years of diligent efforts and literally millions of dollars in investment that have gone into bulding out the PEER :ref:`architecture` and Private Access services, PEER is currently acknowledged as being the leader in building tools and creating communities around this core principle.  The decision to move the PEER code into open source is consciously designed not only to further that goal, but to dramatically accelerate its adoption and use.

We consider ourselves not simply a tecnology platform or a group of project initiatives sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.  As the present steward on behalf of this work, Genetic Alliance provides the infrastructure for convening the community and advancing these projects through mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, etc. 

These resources are maintained by a few paid contractors and internal Genetic Alliance staff (as well as by large amounts of volunteer effort). By sponsoring the PEER OSS Community through an earmarked one-time gift or annual membership, you show your support for our mission and help sustain a vibrant organization. Sponsorship also shows your support for Open Source and provides you the opportunity to "give back" to the community, either through contibuting funds or in-kind services. 

Finally, since Genetic Alliance is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, sponsorship by individuals or a family office may result in attractive tax benefits.


Joining the PEER OSS community
==============================

**Step 1**:  Express interest in taking part in the community

**Step 2**:  Unless your organization is already using PEER, then complete a brief information form and review and execute the PEER OSS community membership agreement.

**Step 3**:  Once the signed agreement is received, Genetic Alliance will issue an invoice for the membership dues, and your membership will be activated.  

Your sponsorship will run for one year after the date of receipt of payment. For this period, we shall display your logo on our thanks page.  Two months before the end of your sponsorship, we will contact you to request renewal. If renewal has not occurred by the renewal date of the sponsorship, Genetic Alliance may remove the sponsor's logo from the thanks page.

Thank you for your support!

In-kind contributions are valued at cost in the year incurred or expended, and credit against the next annual membership payment for that entity or individual.

|   **Indv** = Individual contributor
|   **Educ/HC** = Educational or academic institution, or a non profilt healthcare institution such as a hospital or medical center. For profit health care organizations are treated as businesses, and assessed based on their employee size.
|   **NP Org** = Non-profit support organization

|   **Small companies** = Under 100 employees
|   **Medium** = 101 - 2500 employees

.. Note::  Another approach that appears popular by some of the better known OSS initiatives is through Platinum, Gold, Sliver, Bronze level sponsorhips.  See for example `Apache foundation <http://www.apache.org/foundation/`_, `Linux Foundation <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/members/join>`_.
