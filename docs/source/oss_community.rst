Why Open Source PEER?
=====================

It's time. PEER was created to be a patient driven source of information about that any disease group can access on reasonable terms. 

Open Source ensures that community PEER was created to serve can drive evolution and use of the system without restrictions. 

The decision to move the PEER code into open source is consciously designed to help ensure high quality software that is stable, sustainable and robust in features, but to dramatically accelerate its broadest possible adoption and use.

Joining the PEER OSS community
==============================

PEER software code will be controlled by the open source community.  However, the installation and running of the PEER platform will be Software as a Service (SaaS) where any organization can establish a customized registry "portal" to serve their disease or consituents.

Genetic Alliance has created Membership Levels for organizations will support the core team that will drive the open source community and infrastructure for operating the PEER SaaS platform.  


What an amazing opportunity!
============================

Thanks to years of diligent efforts and literally millions of dollars in investment that have gone into bulding out the PEER :ref:`architecture` and Private Access services, PEER is currently acknowledged as being the leader in building tools and creating communities that embody the foundational principle of being participant-centered, meaning that each particpant is able to determine how much or little of his or her information is shared with others, when and for what purpose.  


Your support is essential
=========================

By sponsoring the PEER OSS Community through a one-time gift or annual membership, you show your support for the PEER mission and help to sustain a vibrant organization.  Sponsorship also shows your support for Open Source and provides you the opportunity to "give back" to the community, either through contibuting funds or in-kind services.

What's Next?
============================

During 2016, the three activities to which all membership fees that are collected are being expended are:

|   1.  Auditing, scrubbing and documenting the PEER source code as a prepatory activity to migrating it to the open source repository 
|   
|   2.  Establishing the governance and licensing structure necessary to formalize the open source grant by Genetic Alliance
|   
|   3.  Salaries and costs for the staff that are required to handle the administrtive and support duties for the code reposity
|   
Genetic Alliance plans to convene all Directors and Members in early 2017 to review the success of the foregoing activities and to establish the PEER OSS initiative priorities for 2017.
